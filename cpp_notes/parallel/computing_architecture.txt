* Kinds of the Parrallel Operating 

1. SISD (Single Instruction Single Data)

2. SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data)
    - Two Processes do the same instruction, but on the different data set.
    - example GPU

3. MISD (Multiple Instruction on Single Data)
    - Multiple Processors do the different instruction for one data stream.

4. MIMD (Multiple Instruction on Multiple Data)
    - SPMD : Single Program Multiple Data
        => The same program is run on the multiple processors(Via Flow Control).
    - MPMD : Multiple PRogram Multiple Data
        => Host Program make other processors run other programs(Nodes).


* Classification via memory model.
1. Shared Memory
 - All processors accest the same memory with the global address
 - All processors should not exist in one physical system.
 - UMA(Uniform Memory Access)
        => All processors can access the shared memory equally and fast.
        => SMP(Symmetric Muli-Processing System)
            - Main Memory <=> System Bus <=> CPU Cache <=> CPU
                                         <=> CPU Cache <=> CPU
                                         <=> CPU Cache <=> CPU
                                         <=> CPU Cache <=> CPU
                                                => Cache Coherence Problem
 - Non-Uniform Memory Acces(NUMA)
    - Several UMA is connected via system bus
    - Some memory is accessed as 


2. Distributed Memory
 - All processor uses local independent memory and communicate only via network communication.


 * Concurrency and Parallel
 - Concurrency is about the program structure, where several flow can be executed independently.
    => This could mean parallel execution, but it can be executed in the turn-in-turn manner by one processor.

 - Parallel execution means execution by several processors.
